			Katalog HOW TO

This document describes how to start using Katalog.

1. Installation

To install Katalog, cd to source directory and run following command as root:

# make install

2. Configure Katalog

In /usr/local/etc You will find file named katalogrc. It is main configuration
file for katalog. You can copy it to Your home directory as .katalogrc. Edit the
configuration file, You can set $data to directory in Your home dir if You don't
want to share databases with other users.

3. Add first base

To add a base, insert CD-ROM into drive and run command:

# katadd short_description "Very long base description"

'short_description' is the name of file that will be created in directory with
bases, and "Very long base description" will be placed in the
short_description.dsc file.

4. Check if base was created

To check if base was created, run:

# katls

You should see name of base that You just created.

5. Search for a file

To search for a file in bases run:

# katsch "expression"

Where "expression" is egrep(1) style regular expression. For example:

# katsch "/linux-[24].*\.tar\.gz"

6. There are some advises from Don Dufresne:

You will need to decide on a preliminary numbering scheme that allows for growth
of your database over the life of the system. A database that allows for 9999
ultimate entries could begin with the command:

# katadd 0001 CD0001 -a -e

This will create entry 0001.dsc, a corresponding 0001 gzip file, place the text
"CD0001" in the 0001.dsc file, read and 'katalog' the contents of the CD, and
eject the CD.  

You would then enter the command:

# pico /usr/share/katalog/0001.dsc

The file would reveal the text "CD0001"

Here you can establish additional title data, such as:

CD 0001
Project Archive
Freshmeat
02/03/2003

This title information will be included on all 'katsch' or katls' searches and
provides additional descriptive information when searching through a long list
of returned data when searching your archive.
